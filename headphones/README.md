# 🎧 Headphones Landing Page

Welcome to the **Headphones Landing Page** — a sleek, modern, and fully responsive web page built with pure HTML and CSS. Designed with elegance, clarity, and engagement in mind, this page showcases a fictional headphone brand through bold visuals, clean typography, and smooth user experience.

This project is part of the [ALX Software Engineering Program](https://www.alxafrica.com/) and is inspired by a Figma UI mockup provided for frontend implementation practice.

## 🖼️ Design Philosophy

The design plays on contrast — deep navy tones for immersive product visuals, soft whites for balance, and a vibrant coral (`#FF6565`) for calls to action. The layout smoothly adapts across devices, retaining visual hierarchy and aesthetic sharpness.

> “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” – Steve Jobs
